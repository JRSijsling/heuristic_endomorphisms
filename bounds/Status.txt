Done:
1) proving that two elliptic curves are non-isogenous, over the ground field or over the algebraic closure (NonIsogenous.sage)
2) proving that an abelian surface is not QM (NonQM.sage)
3) proving that an abelian variety is absolutely irreducible, modulo waiting for a better bound on the minimal field of definition of a splitting (GeometricallyIrreducible)
4) if J is geometrically simple of dimension 2 or 3 (or 1, I guess, but I didn't test it) and has commutative endomorphism ring, spit out a bound for the rank of End_{K bar}(J) over ZZ (EndomorphismRankBound.sage)
5) Tested (4) with full CM, Picard curves, and RM (Test.sage)
6) if 
- J has dimension 3
- there is a map J \to E
- the complement abelian surface A is irreducible with commutative endomorphism ring
then can perform same computations as in (4), only way less tested

To do:
- compute the genus 2 factor when it exists
- put everything together with Jeroen's code to provide full certification
- find a less painful way to obtain L-polynomials! Ask drew about this
