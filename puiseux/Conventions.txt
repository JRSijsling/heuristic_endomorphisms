Curves are given by a single planar defining equation, possibly with a singularity
We take a non-Weierstrass base point
We use an affine patch, by default the standard one, unless the base point used is at infinity
A uniformizer is chosen in a standard preferred way, as is a basis of differentials
Differentials are represented by rational functions times the differential of the given uniformizer
